//! Coordinates piece download state by wrapping ChunkTracker with inflight piece tracking.
//!
//! This module provides the [`PieceTracker`] type which encapsulates the relationship between
//! queued pieces (in ChunkTracker) and in-flight pieces (being downloaded by a peer).
//!
//! The key invariant maintained is: a piece is in exactly one state at any time:
//! - HAVE (completed)
//! - QUEUED (available to download)
//! - IN_FLIGHT (currently being downloaded)
//! - NOT_NEEDED (not selected for download)
